		<h3>A Little About Myself</h3>
		<p>My name is <b>Thi Hai Ngoc Nguyen</b>, a student of IDP3 Jan intake 2019.<br>            I’m 99% sure no Non-Vietnamese could ever pronounce my name properly<br>                <I>( life experien ce)</I>, so you can call me Megan.
		</p>
	     <p>I was born and raised in Vietnam. Grow up thinking I’m going to be a lawyer,<br>    I end up studying Media design at Fanshawe College. But It’s just how life is.<br>       My favorite color is yellow, the happy banana type of yellow. Just like my<br> favorite color, I’m a cheerful and friendly person who love to cook and enjoy<br> moments with my friends.
