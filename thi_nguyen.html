		<h3>A Little About Myself</h3>
		<p>My name is <b>Thi Hai Ngoc Nguyen</b>, a student of IDP3 Jan intake 2019.<br>I’m 99% sure no Non-Vietnamese could ever pronounce my name properly<br><I>(life experience)</I>, so you can call me Megan.</p>
        <p>I was born and raised in Vietnam. Grew up thinking I was going to be a lawyer,<br>I end up studying Media design at Fanshawe College. But It’s just how life is.<br>My favorite color is yellow, the happy banana type of yellow. Just like my<br>favorite color, I’m a cheerful and friendly person who loves to cook and enjoy<br>moments with my friends.</p>

		<h3>What I learned about <a href="jeffrey.html">Jeffrey</a></h3>
		<p>Jeff is an ambitious man, wanting to be the boss of his own studio. I have no<br> doubt about that. Besides, he has the most <b>beautiful hair</b> I’ve ever seen.<br>  I’m honestly so jealous.</p>
