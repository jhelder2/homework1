        <h3>A Little About Myself</h3>
        
        <p>My Name is Jeffrey Helder, born December 21st 1996. I've been off school now for almost five years.<br> I have worked as an apartment building manager, first year automotive apprentice, and most recently<br/> was a labourer/forklift operator at a warehouse in Cambridge. I've been <i>slowly</i> learning the basics to<br/>the film/animation pipeline, 3D design, figure drawing, marketing/advertising and basic art skills over<br/>the past two years. My goals and admiration in life is to be a better designer than I can imagine.<br/><b>I want to work primarily with 3D design</b> because I see a huge pull towards it in today/tomorrow's<br/>market, but would like to be multi-talented with front and backhouse applications. The end goal (<i>after<br/>
        many years of learning, struggling, and crying</i>) is to <b>operate my own studio</b>. As much as I don't like<br/>it because it’s high risk, competitive, and incredibly hard to get into, the fire to my passion is<br/>entertainment. Animation esspecally.</p>
    
        <p>I'm back in school now because I got tired of telling myself;<br/>“<i>you have the rest of your life to follow your dreams</i>”.</p>
